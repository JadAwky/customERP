# Custom ERP Project (ERPNext / Frappe)
The goal is to leverage ERPNext’s core capabilities while implementing custom business workflows, UI changes, and reports so the system behaves and looks like a bespoke ERP, not a standard ERPNext installation.  This repository is intentionally kept minimal and high-level. Core business logic and private code are maintained in private repositories.

## Project Scope

This project is a **custom ERP built on top of ERPNext / Frappe**, focused on real-world business needs rather than standard ERP configurations.

**Focus areas include:**
- Accounting workflows
- Stock, Buying & Selling
- Custom reports
- Custom UI / UX
- Workflow automation

The system places strong emphasis on **correct accounting behavior**, practical business use cases, and is designed for **performance and scalability**.
