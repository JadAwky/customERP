# customERP
The goal is to leverage ERPNext’s core capabilities while implementing custom business workflows, UI changes, and reports so the system behaves and looks like a bespoke ERP, not a standard ERPNext installation.  This repository is intentionally kept minimal and high-level. Core business logic and private code are maintained in private repositories.
